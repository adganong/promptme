# TODO need to modify my urls so that singles can be retrieved
# TODO decide exactly what singles need to be retrieved
# TODO Make pseudo code for retrieving the different version of random prompts (including tests)
# Todo build the basic version of retrieving a single prompt
# todo fix url paths on develop so that they are all contained within a urls folder or something

I need to decide how exact I want my tests to be. I sort of want to be able to actually test the data that
is returned but that may end up being too tricky with how Django handles responses. If I can get it figured
out though I can use the built dictionary

I am skipping over some of the tests for now so that I can get on to real stuff, then I'll get back to testing later
because this testing is getting aggravating and I DO have tests, just not as robust as they should be
